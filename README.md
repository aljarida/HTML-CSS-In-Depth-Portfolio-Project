# HTML-CSS-In-Depth-Portfolio-Project

I created this HTML- and CSS-powered webpage as part of the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certification available on Coursera.
The webpage is fully mobile responsive and uses a combination of flexboxes and grids. It uses various pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
The logos used for the mock Lucky Shrub webpage are provided by Meta in the course, but all other design elements including the color palette
are self-derived.
